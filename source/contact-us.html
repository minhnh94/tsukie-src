We are software programmers couple who are learning to be a writer.<br>
Beside our full-time work as a programmer (we have experience with a plethora of technologies such as Swift/PHP/ObjC/MySQL/JS and its popular frameworks...), we enjoy reading and writing to try expressing our ideas and thought to the world.<br>
You can found our publications here or on our Medium channel: https://medium.com/@minhnh.da.
