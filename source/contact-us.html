We are a software developer/gamer/anime manga otaku couple.<br>
This is, while serving as our personal page, is our scratchyard of writing ideas.<br>
Our website will continuously evolve, and will be continuously developed. Please cheer for us ^^<br>
Also, we do public our website source code at https://github.com/minhnh94/tsukie-src.git and https://github.com/minhnh94/tsukie-theme-src.git. An usage manual and (probably) contribution manual will be published later. We would appreciate you to try our tweaked theme and give feedback to us.<br>
Any inquiries please mail to <strong>minhnh.da@gmail.com</strong>. Have a good day!
