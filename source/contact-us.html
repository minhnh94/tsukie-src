<h1>What is Tsukie?</h1>
"Tsukie" in Japanese means "to the moon". "To the moon" is a title of the RPG that tells a beautiful story about the adventure of two doctors trying to help the soon-to-be-deceased people have their last wish fulfilled in their dream. It is literally a "game", but actually a movie, with the plot gently developed, doesn't feel rushed, heart-touching, and has a satisfying ending. The game was one of our best experiences we have tried, and we decided to use the title of our most liked game as our website name!<br>

Our "to the moon", beside storytelling, will be where we'll share our thought, ideas, experiences, what we learned or what we think it would be useful... Currently, most of the articles are software programming oriented, self-help oriented, but in the future, we would like to expand the categories to other realms. This website will be inflated and become a mixed hotpot of experience ^^.
We hope you will find our "to the moon" journey joyful and helpful!
