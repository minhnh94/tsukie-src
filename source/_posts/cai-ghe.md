When we were kids, we often saw the world through our pink goggles. Making friends, going out... everything seemed so carefree at that time. But, at the time we grew up, things changed like a flash of light. The society connects its people with intention and calculation. Gradually, we became more and more cautious, paranoid, without us even noticing it. And by the time, we are more harsh at diagnosing and judging others' every action.

Hopefully, the story below can somehow cure a part of thorns of doubt in us. There are still people who communicate with others with pure mind, they just need a little more time to prove themselves.

Because, while bathed in unjustness, the world is still embracing many beautiful moments, waiting to be unveiled.

Khi chúng ta còn nhỏ, mọi thứ đều được nhìn qua một lăng kính màu hồng.
