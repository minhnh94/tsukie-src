Have we ever questioned ourself that since when we gradually became more and more cautious, paranoid to others' behaviours without even noticing it. Since when we hardened our shields and made them face the life, in order to protect our fragile hearts from the tide of the life.  

While surfing on the Internet this short comic below caught my glimpse. Maybe everyone can see a part of ourselves in this short comic. Hopefully, the story can somehow cure a part of thorns of doubt in us.

Because, while bathed in unjustness, the world is still embracing many beautiful moments, waiting to be unveiled.
